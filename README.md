# Feed Reader Testing

The objective of this project was to write code to test the functionality of a feed reader Web application that reads RSS feeds. The tests were written using the Jasmine framework.

## Tested Functionality

Some of the apps features that were tested includes the following:

* RSS Feeds - verified & tested that required variables was declared and values were assigned

*  The Menu - verified that the app's menu was hidden when page loads. Also verified that the menu appears when the menu icon was clicked and disappears when menu icon was clicked again.

* Initial Entries - tested the functionality of the asynchronous loadFeed function to ensure that it loads the RSS feeds.

* New Feed Selection - further tested the asychronous loadFeed function to enure that when each feed is loaded that its content is different.
